# **Project One: Visualizing Anger | Bhuwanyu Agrawal (2025)**
*A digital composition created in P5.js showing sharp overlapping triangles in shades of red and black on a dark gray background. The bright red triangles appear to burst outward, while deeper maroon shadows extend behind them, giving the sense of tension, chaos, and aggression.*

**Description and Inspiration**
This project was an exercise in visual design using only one geometric shape—in my case, the triangle—to express the emotion anger.
The project began with the basic tools and concepts I learned on the first day of exploring P5.js. I initially sketched the layout on Procreate, experimenting with sharp angles and overlapping forms to capture the raw, pointed energy that anger often carries.

Triangles felt like the perfect representation of this emotion. Their sharp edges, aggressive points, and dynamic geometry naturally evoke tension and instability.

**Design Objectives**
The main objective was to communicate anger without words or figurative imagery, relying solely on shape, color, and composition.

*To achieve this, I focused on:*

- **Using triangles exclusively to explore emotional expression through geometry.

- **Creating visual tension through overlapping, imbalance, and directionality.

- **Building a layered composition using both bright and dark tones to convey intensity and depth.

- **Maintaining simplicity within the constraints of P5.js basics, without using external textures or complex forms.

**Process**
I began by translating my Procreate sketch into P5.js, using basic drawing functions like triangle() to build the initial structure.
While experimenting further, I discovered the use of vertices (beginShape() and vertex()) in P5.js, which opened up more creative control over irregular triangular shapes. This discovery became a key turning point in the composition.

As I built the forms, I added shadow layers darker red triangles positioned behind the bright ones. This was an instant idea that came during the process, symbolizing the suppressed or underlying rage behind visible expressions of anger.

The black triangle in the center represents an individual, surrounded and consumed by their own shattered thoughts (the bright red triangles) and shadowed emotions (the darker red forms).

**Visual Composition**

*Base color: *Dark gray background to intensify contrast.

*Primary shapes:* Bright red and dark maroon triangles.

*Structure:* Asymmetrical composition radiating outward to represent emotional outburst.

*Shadows:* Layered behind the brighter triangles to suggest the lingering presence of suppressed anger.

**Through this project, I learned:**

- **How to use P5.js’s vertex system for creative freedom.

- **The importance of conceptual thinking even in a minimal visual exercise.

**Outcome and Reflection**

The final composition successfully conveys anger through geometric abstraction. The process also deepened my understanding of how computational tools like P5.js can be used not only for interactivity but for visual storytelling through form.
This project marked my first step in merging artistic intuition with coding logic, and set the tone for my exploration of emotional expression through digital design.
