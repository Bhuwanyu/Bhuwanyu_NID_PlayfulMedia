# **Project Two: From Anger to Wonder | Bhuwanyu Agrawal (2025)**
A dynamic digital composition created in P5.js, animating triangles to represent the transformation of *anger into wonder*. Dark red and maroon triangles initially dominate the canvas, symbolizing chaotic anger, while a central triangle gradually grows and transitions through dark, bright, and finally colorful layers, visually narrating the journey from tension to cheerful/wonder state.

**Description and Inspiration**
This project was an extension of my first project on visualizing anger. On the second day of learning P5.js, we explored variables, which allowed me to introduce movement, growth, fading, and pacing into my work.
The concept of this project was to transform the static representation of anger into a dynamic visualization of emotional growth and wonder. The animation depicts how chaotic and overwhelming thoughts gradually fade, while a central figure emerges into wonder. This was inspired by the idea that intense emotions, though initially disruptive, can evolve into clarity and flow when properly expressed or processed.

**Design Objectives**
*The main objective was to convey emotional transformation using triangles, color, motion, and variable-driven animation.*
*To achieve this, I focused on:*

- **Animating the existing anger triangles to slowly fade out, symbolizing the dissipation of chaotic thoughts.

- **Creating a central triangle that grows over time, transitioning in color from black -> dark red -> bright and finally colorful, representing clarity emerging from anger.

- **Using variables to control motion, opacity, and size, demonstrating how coding logic can represent emotional progression.

- **Increasing frame rate over time, reflecting the shift from rough, difficult emotional turbulence to smooth, flowing wonder.

- **Layering smaller triangles radiating outward to illustrate the spreading of clarity and cheefulness from the individualâ€™s emotional center.

**Process**
The project began by adapting the triangle layout from the first project, maintaining the core visual language of sharp, overlapping triangles.

*Key steps included:*

- Introducing a variable a to control the fading of anger triangles, movement of the shattered thoughts, and growth of the central triangle.

- Gradually increasing the frame rate as the animation progressed, symbolizing the journey from struggle to emotional flow.

- Experimenting with color transitions for the central triangle, moving from dark muted tones to vibrant, colorful layers, representing the emergence of wonder.

- Adding multiple layers of small triangles radiating outward to enhance the sense of energy, growth, and wonder.

**Visual Composition**
*Base color:* Dark gray background, maintaining continuity from Project One while emphasizing contrast.

*Primary shapes:*

- Anger triangles: Dark red and maroon triangles scattered asymmetrically.

- Emergent triangles: Central equilateral triangle growing and transitioning through colors to symbolize wonder.

***Structure:***

*Initial frames:* Rough, uneven motion of triangles reflects anger.

*Later frames:* Smooth, colorful expansion reflects harmony and flow.

**Through this project, I learned:**
- How to apply variables to animate properties such as size, opacity, and color in P5.js.

- The importance of motion and pacing in visual storytelling, particularly for representing emotional evolution.

- How color progression and frame rate can metaphorically convey the transition from struggle to flow.

- Ways to build continuity between projects, transforming static compositions into dynamic narratives.

**Outcome and Reflection**
The final composition effectively narrates the transition from anger to wonder, showing how emotional state can evolve into clarity and positivity. By combining variable-driven animation, color transitions, and layered motion, the project conveys not just the visual aesthetics of triangles, but also a story of emotional growth.
This project deepened my understanding of how coding logic, motion, and color interplay can be used for conceptual storytelling in digital art. It serves as a bridge between static emotional representation and dynamic narrative exploration.
