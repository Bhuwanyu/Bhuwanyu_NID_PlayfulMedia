# **Project 5: Sprite Sheet Experimentation |Bhuwanyu Agrawal (2025)**
This project explores sprite sheets and interactive animation in p5.js. The aim was to understand how images can be divided into grids, stored in arrays, and manipulated to create a player-controlled sprite. The focus was on experimentation, using a pre-existing working sprite sheetbcode and gradually adding own sprite sheet and experiment around interaction through Keys.

**Process**
- Found a sprite sheet online.
- Sprite Sheet Setup in Photoshop
- Implemented it into prewritten starter code that divided the sprite sheet into frames using a grid system.
- Stored each frame in an array for easy access and animation.
- Played the sprite sheet as a looped animation for a moving character.
- Learned how frame indices and arrays work together to create smooth sprite animation.

**Experimentation & Interaction**
- Added key interactions: controlling the sprite with keyboard inputs.
- Played around with animation speed, frame selection, and movement.
- Experimented with background changes.
- Explored how changing variables like frame rate, position, and background color affects the overall feel of the animation.

**Outcome**
- A working interactive sprite animation with player control.
- Clear understanding of arrays, grids, and frame management in sprite sheets.
- Demonstrates experimentation and creativity in interactive digital art.

**Learnings**
- How sprite sheets are structured and how to extract frames using arrays.
- How player interactions can be linked to sprite animations.
- The value of hands-on experimentation to understand technical concepts in interactive design.
