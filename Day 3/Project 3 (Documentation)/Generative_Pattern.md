# Project Three: 10PRINT Pattern | Bhuwanyu Agrawal (2025)
A generative pattern made in P5.js using nested loops and randomness.

**Description**
This project is inspired by the classic 10PRINT pattern, which uses random diagonal lines to create maze-like visuals.
I recreated and expanded the idea using nested for loops and random shapes like lines, rectangles, and circles.
Each time the program runs, it generates a new, unpredictable pattern.

**Outcome**
The result is a grid of colorful lines, rectangles, and circles on a dark background.
The mix of order and randomness makes every version look unique and continuous geometric pattern in space.

**Learning**
This project taught me how loops and random values can be used to create generative art,turning simple code into endless visual possibilities.
