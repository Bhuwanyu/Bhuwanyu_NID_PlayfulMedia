# Project 4: Generative Image Pattern Exploration | Bhuwanyu Agrawal (2025)
This project is an experimental exploration of generative patterns through handmade reepetive patterns. The goal is to learn how repetition, arrays, and loops can create continuous motifs across a canvas. Currently, the work is in progress, focusing on experimentation and drawing a repeative pattern as my current one is not repeative.

**Process**
- Motif Experimentation
- Created a custom shape/motif in procreate
- Experimenting with different arrangements, spacing, and variations.
- Using arrays to store Images.
- Each immage can pick from arrays to explore dynamic visual outcomes.

**Grid and Pattern Trials**
- Attempting grid placement to produce continuous repetition.
- Testing different offsets and tiling strategies to see how patterns interact across the canvas.
- Not taking any external inspiration to come up with some unique patterns through the blend of art skills & code.

**Current Outcome**
- Shapes are generated on the canvas, but a fully continuous, repetitive pattern is still in progress.
- Shows early experimentation with repetition, variation, and arrays.
- Demonstrates the potential of generative art to produce complex visuals from simple rules.

**Learnings**
- How repetition, variation, and arrays interact in generative design.
- Exploring how simple coding rules can lead to emergent patterns.
